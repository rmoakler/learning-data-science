We can simply count word frequency or occurence and use these as simple features. One way to correct for this simplification is to use **n-grams**. An n-gram will allow us to capture some of the word order that was in our text. For example, in the sentence \"The movie is not bad.\", instead of treating \"not\" and \"bad\" separately, we can use bigrams to account for \"not bad\" as a single token.
